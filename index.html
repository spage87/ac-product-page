            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Choose your fate in Assassin's Creed&reg; Odyssey.</p>
            <p>From outcast to living legend, embark on an odyssey to uncover the secrets of your past and change the
                fate of Ancient Greece.</p>

            <p>TRAVEL TO ANCIENT GREECE<br>
                From lush vibrant forests to volcanic islands and bustling cities, start a journey of exploration and
                encounters in a war torn world shaped by gods and men.</p>

            <p>FORGE YOUR LEGEND<br>
                Your decisions will impact how your odyssey unfolds. Play through multiple endings thanks to the new
                dialogue system and the choices you make. Customize your gear, ship, and special abilities to become a
                legend.</p>

            <p>FIGHT ON A NEW SCALE<br>
                Demonstrate your warrior's abilities in large scale epic battles between Athens and Sparta featuring
                hundreds of soldiers, or ram and cleave your way through entire fleets in naval battles across the
                Aegean Sea.</p>

            <p>GAZE IN WONDER<br>
                Experience the action in a whole new light with Tobii Eye Tracking. The Extended View feature gives you
                a broader perspective of the environment, and the Dynamic Light and Sun Effects immerse you in the
                sandy dunes according to where you set your sights. Tagging, aiming and locking on your targets becomes
                a lot more natural when you can do it by looking at them. Let your vision lead the way and enhance your
                gameplay.
